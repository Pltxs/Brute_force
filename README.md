# Brute_force Algorithm

#### Hi there!
  This repository was my first project after my transition to Software Development. 
  
  So it may not include best practices, DRY etc. and may be it is even not working. 
  But I'm still keeping it here because you know it is a reminder for me from which 
  point I started and where I am now.
  
  ## What is the repository about?
 
  The program has almost all the keyboard characters and searches for the password 
  according to your choice. You have the opportunity of just looking for alphanumerical
  characters or just uppercases etc. which is really cool.
  
  The password is predeclared in program as I've said it was a beginner project.
